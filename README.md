Everyone is aware of global worming caused by the increased CO2 content and CH4 content in our atmosphere, the former being caused by 
the combustion of fossile fuels and the latter being caused by thawing of tundra and gas flares. It is also well known that the international 
community (i.e. the Paris Agreement of 2015) strives to limit global warming to about 1.5 Celsius degrees (i.e. 2.7 Fahrenheit degrees) 
as compared to pre-industrial levels.

This project looks at temperature changes at Washington, DC's Reagan National Airport (aka DCA) over the last 77 years. I graph out the 
average highs and average lows for each month over the 77 year period (24 graphs) to see if certain months have larger temperature increases than others,
and whether any patterns or conclusions can be drawn from the graphs. I also examine extreme highs and lows (i.e. winter lows and summer highs), 
and see whether global warming manifests in the frequency of extreme temperatures.

The data was imported from the National Centers for Environmental Information of NOAA (i.e. the National Weather Service)
